# dctowerliftsapp

App written with JAVA for the CIC (from IBM) challenge, July-August 2019.

###### AUTHOR
Lluis Carrasco Martinez (Beginner in this amazing world of Programming)

Note from the Author:
I do not consider this Challenge as finished, for my actual knownledge does not allow me to write a nicer and more efficient
solution. However, I just landed in the world of IT and Telecommunications, and when I look back, I feel I really learnt
quite something the last semesters.
If you download the project, feel free to play, change it and share your thoughts, any constructive comment will be 
very welcome.


###### GETTING STARTED
The project was written using the Intellij IDEA. Of course, another IDEA may be used
Java version 8
Maven version 3.6.0

NOTE:
In case the dependencies eventually are not recongnized, do not change them manually, try from the CLI, in the directory
where is the app: directoryWhereTheAppIs$mvn clean install

###### TESTS
I tested the methods using the jUnit test in the AppTest.java class that the IDEA created when i first created the project.

###### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
I want to thank my College colleagues, for the fun I have with them while programming, and to my family and friends, for
supporting me though they do not always understand what exactly I am doing.


Thanks for passing by, and lots of fun in this software-engineering adventure.
11uis ;)
